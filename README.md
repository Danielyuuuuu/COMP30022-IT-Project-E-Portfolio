# README

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### GOTO `https://app.slack.com/client/T0187HJ1YNN/C01A7AA2FS8` To download the `.env` file, put it under `server` directory.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npx prettier --write .`

Use Prettier to format everything, except the files specified in `.prettierignore`.  
 Or you may use `prettier --write app/` to format a certain directory,  
 or `prettier --write app/components/Button.js` to format a certain file.  
 Or use a glob like `prettier --write "app/**/*.test.js` to format all tests in a directory.

Under the `server` directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the server in the development mode.  
 Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
 You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`

Similar to `npm start` but any changes in code will reflect the changes on the website in runtime.

### `npm run dev`

Equals to running `npm run server` in the `server` directory and running `npm start` in the `client` directory.  
It runs both the server and client within a single terminal.
